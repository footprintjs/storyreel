# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — first release for other projects

- **Director notes** (`recipe.notes`): `speed` (every camera move), `cut` (a scene starts on a hard cut;
  also `enter: "cut"`), `push` (the camera pushes in on a point from one phrase to another). A note the
  film cannot honour refuses; `film.notes` and the making-of record list each as applied.
- **Preview studio** (`footprint-storyreel/studio`): a local, read-only page — scrub, play with the voice,
  click a drawing to see the recipe entry (and its line) that drew it; compiles again on save.
- **What drew this spot:** `film.regionsAt(t)`, `film.pointAt(t, x, y)`, and the recipe path on every beat.
- **Reading time:** `film.reading` lists lines shown for less than about 0.3 s a word; `"reading": "refuse"`.
- **Stills:** `film.moments()` (settled pictures and changes half way) and `contactSheet(film)`.
- **A poster:** `recipe.poster` names a frame; the renderer writes `poster.jpg` and makes it the video's first frame.
- Story kits receive `motion` (`{cameraSpeed}`) and may declare `motion: ['cameraSpeed']`, `regionsAt(t)`, `texts()`.
- A push-in that would still be running when the card moves aside now refuses the recipe.
- TypeScript types. The `hello` example's push-in is quicker (0.3 s rest, 1.8 s turn) so its caption can be read.

## 0.1.0

The engine as used by the AgentFootprint video course: storyboard + recipe → one seekable film,
whiteboard / paper / cartoon kits, worlds as shots with fades, wipes, irises and page turns,
pause-and-guess, a string table, pacing for voiced and silent cuts, pixel pins, a footprintjs making-of record.
